        <p>Mew ? <br> How's the loveliest, sweetest, pretiest girl rn?........um....so...i thought i should write you a love letter but then i thought it might be lame so i did an ever lamer thing and made this site....please don't hate me ....Anyways this
            is not about me this is about the apple of my eye, the light of my heart, centre of all my desires,this is about you. Ever since i saw you i knew i was gonna fall for you, it took a few months, but everytime i saw you i thought ' a lot of
            suffering is coming for me '. I don't mean that in a sarcastic manner btw, that's just what i thought to myself at that time because of that saying 'Beauty is short lived tyranny'.....blah blah. Btw Why did you stop wearing eyeliner??....You
            looked so gorgeous with that...Not that your eyes need it .......Gosh your eyes are so beautiful.....i don't write poems anymore but like i can pay someone to write such deep lines about your eyes......AAAAA...And your laugh is cute...almost
            like a little child..... You know i can go on about how beautiful you are and how that's an attractive thing but i don't think that's your most attractive quality. I think your most attractive quality is how you beahve....so politely. Its
            just....how can someone so amazing be so humble. Blew me away the first time i heard you speak. voice is angelic('drooling face emoji')....... Maham( Your name is so lovely btw,,,,,Maham Maham Mahama///////sry),.......is everything about you
            so great or am i just horny... [._.] i have so much love for you,,,,i can't even express it all. sometimes, i just freeze when i see you makes me so nervous to think that i would do or say something stupid and then you will never like me.
            Are you really real? Feels like every romance novel i ever read( i have only read like 5 or 6) was based on you. Another thing that draws me to you is how carefree you are. idk if that's true but you seem like it and since i have always been
            imprisoned by something at every point in time so that free-ness is like a dream to me, and every thought of you feels like that dream coming true. <br> you are making me somthing, idk better or worse but idk i'm becoming carefree as well
            and Thank you for that. i feel like it is one of those stories in which an ordinary boy falls in love with a princess and the boy can wish for her, pray for her and maybe even gets to tell her how he feels but its umimaginable how they can
            end up thogether. And just like that this ordinary boy is gonna do stupid embarassing things for this princess. You can just sit back and laugh at me......uuughhh.<br><br> Its actually my first experience with this thing so i don't really
            know what to write.....Ummm...Do you also feel like i should give up on you? Because everyone has been telling me that for sometime now. But how can someone just give up on someone they care so much about. I finally, finally found someone
            who feels so attractive and still humble, so far yet so warm, how can i just stop wanting you? loving you? When i think about you, i know that i can do any strange, crazy thing for you, i would never do anything for anyone else. I can see
            myself erasing even my own self to become the person that you might want me to be, how will someone ever become this important for me again? Idk about you but i am one of those people who just fall for someone and then that someone is their
            everything. And i will keep trying to find ways to win your heart, i hope that's still possible for me given my past behavior and everything.<br><br> Maham, very sincerely, please don't feel overwhelmed, i don't want an answer from you right
            away..take a year, a lifetime even i don't really care. Maybe you are not sure about me, maybe you don't like relationships in general because of islamic point of view. Whatever it is, this letter is only for letting you know how i feel about
            you, and that you know now, its not for giving you any sort of headache.... Just one last thing,,,,if you ever feel like i can be the right person for you, let me know. I love you, Maham. Very very much. Please let it be you and me in the
            end!
            <br> {Hope you are smiling :)}</p>
